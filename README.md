# TBI-Patient-Analysis
The analysis of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an extensive attempt to understand the complex nature of TBI, which reveals a variety of detailed data on causes, therapy methods, symptoms, age, and gender. Our systematic database schemas and logical entity-relationship diagrams ensure data integrity, enabling seamless information management and organisation. The quality of the dataset is improved by advanced data cleaning methods, providing a strong foundation for our analysis. Impressive accuracy is achieved in predicting gender-specific outcomes by using models such as Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours, and Support Vector Machine. Healthcare providers and researchers can leverage the findings, backed by an effective database architecture, ultimately elevating TBI patient care to new heights.
